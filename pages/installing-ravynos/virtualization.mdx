# Virtualization Setup
ravynOS currently does not support graphics under virtual machines, however progress is underway.
Virtualization is currently efficient for developers to develop and design non-graphical applications without the need to install ravynOS on hardware.

Below are steps on how to setup a virtualized environment for ravynOS to run in.


## Preparing

Make sure you have downloaded our ISO, ready to setup your virtualized environment. You can find our mirror list [here](/download/mirror-list) to download an ISO.

## Setting Up

<Steps>
### Create a new virtual machine
### Select FreeBSD13.1 as the Operating System

In the TianoCore UEFI (enter this with the ESC key), it may be helpful to change the preferred screen resolution via Device Manager > OVMF Platform Configuration to something greater than 1024x768
